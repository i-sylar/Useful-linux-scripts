# **A collection of useful linux scripts**

### **1. disable_touch.sh**
    This simple script disables the touch feature for case (Thinkpad T series) touch screen devices

### **2. enable_touch.sh**
    This is the enables the touch feature as disabled above.

### **3. usbreset.sh**
    After occassionally having my ubuntu fail to mount my usb devices, i deviced this as a quick fix.
# ** In the folder 'CURL'

### **4. curl_them_all.sh**
    In the quest of a little automation, this script does a 'curl -i -X OPTIONS xxxxx -m 7' on a list of domains in the alldomains.txt file. The timeout limit can be increased from 7 to whatever. Beware of fancy outputs. :-D

### **4. url_exists.sh**
    I ocassionally use curl to determine if a URL is up/valid or not. This script basically does the same for multiple URLS listed in the alldomains.txt and outputs it in a structured way.
